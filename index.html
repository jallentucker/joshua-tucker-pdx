                <p class="index-blurb">Hello and thanks for visiting my portfolio site. I'm new to
                    web development and eager to acquire more coding experience and knowledge. In 2012
                    I decided that I wanted to change careers and change my scenery as well. I had long
                    been interested in computer programming, and after first finishing up my B.S. in
                    Statistics at the University of Florida, I packed up my things and drove out to
                    the left coast, ultimately settling in Portland, Orgeon. I've since taken a 12-week
                    crash course in full stack Javascript development at Portland Code School. I'm looking
                    for the right job now, ideally something where I can be mentored as I continue to
                    grow in my new field. In the meantime I'm working on an app to help myself and other
                    fantasy football enthusiasts pick out the right players week in and week out.
                    <br><br>
                    My strengths include the ability to write and clearly document clean, efficient
                    code. Clear documentation facilitates collaboration and the integration of code
                    into the larger application. I was strictly trained to use test-driven development
                    and I am passionate about high code coverage and catching bugs early in the development
                    cycle. Virtually all of my work at Portland Code School was done in teams of three or using pair programming with a partner.
                    <br><br>
